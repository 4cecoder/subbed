## 🔄 Data Flow

### Write Operations
```
User Action → Local Storage (Immediate) → ConvexDB (If Online) → Sync Queue (If Offline)
    ↓
UI Updates → Background Sync (When Online)
```

### Read Operations
```
Data Request → ConvexDB (If Online) → Local Storage (Fallback) → Merged Result
    ↓
Cache Update → UI Display
```

### Sync Process
```
Online Detection → Process Sync Queue → Update ConvexDB → Clear Queue → Update Local Cache
```
