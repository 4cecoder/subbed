This project is a local YouTube subscription manager called "Subbed". It allows users to manage YouTube channel subscriptions without requiring any login or account. The app runs locally, stores subscriptions in a JSON file (despite README mentioning SQLite, the code uses JSON), and fetches public YouTube feeds (oEmbed and Atom) to display video lists. Key features include adding subscriptions by URL/handle/channel ID, viewing aggregated feeds from all subscriptions, viewing individual channel feeds, searching through videos, configuring settings (feed types, display options, performance settings), removing subscriptions, and refreshing feeds. The app is built with Next.js and is designed to be privacy-focused and self-hosted.
