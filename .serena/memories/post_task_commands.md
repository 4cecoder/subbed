Commands to run when a task is completed:

- Linting: `bun run lint` or `npm run lint` to check for code quality issues
- Build: `bun run build` or `npm run build` to ensure the app builds successfully
- No explicit testing setup, so manual testing by running dev server and checking functionality
- If modifying API routes or data handling, test by interacting with the UI and checking data/ files
- For styling changes, check responsive design on different screen sizes
- Commit changes with descriptive messages following conventional commits if using git
